# Basic information

## Online documentation

https://rclUE.readthedocs.io/en/devel/

## Supported versions

Main support

- Ubuntu 20.04
- Unreal Engine 5.10
- ROS2 Foxy
- Clang: 13.0.1

Maintenance/experimental

- Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS2 Humble(`UE5_devel_humble` branch)
- Ubuntu 24.04 and ROS2 Humble(`UE5_devel_jazzy` branch)

Please download UE5.10 for Linux by following [Unreal Engine for Linux](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/linux)

## Branches

- `devel`: This build of the plugin is based on ROS2 Foxy and has been tested on Ubuntu 20 and UE5.10.
- `UE5_devel_foxy`: Same as above.
- `UE5_devel_humble_20.04`(experimental): This build of the plugin is based on ROS 2 humble and has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and UE5.1.
- `UE5_devel_humble`(experimental): This build of the plugin is based on ROS 2 humble, Ubuntu 22.04 and UE5.1.
- `UE5_devel_jazzy`(experimental): This build of the plugin is based on ROS 2 jazzy, Ubuntu 24.04 and UE5.1.


## TroubleShooting

### Missing library
Due to pre-compiled libraries, ThirdParty/ros/lib/librcl.so dynamically links libyaml.so and libspdlog.so.1, which needs to be provided by/installed on the host system. If not, Unreal fails to load the plugin or package the project without further details.

On some operating systems, even with libyaml and libspdlog installed, the version appendix may not exist. You can try creating them using:

```
cd /lib64
ln -s </path/to/libyaml.so.X.Y.Z> libyaml.so
ln -s </path/to/libspdlog.so.X.Y.Z> libspdlog.so.1
```

# rclUE and ROS2

## Description

- We use ros2 'foxy' lightweighted (not all binaries are included). Source/ThirdParty/ros folder is fully autogenerated by [UE_tools](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/UE_tools)
- ros includes [UE_msgs](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/UE_msgs)
- UE uses centimeters but ROS uses meters. Please convert manually or use [URRConversionUtils](https://rapyutasimulationplugins.readthedocs.io/en/devel/doxygen_generated/html/d4/dc1/class_u_r_r_conversion_utils.html) in [RapyutaSimulationPlugins](https://rapyutasimulationplugins.readthedocs.io/en/devel/index.html)
- within the Unreal Editor: Edit->Plugins, search and enable for `rclc`

## Windows is currently unsupported

# Getting Started

The plugin folder contains a video "Example_BP_PubSub.mp4" demonstrating how to setup a PubSub example in Blueprint.

An example setup using this plugin can be found at [turtlebot3-UE](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/turtlebot3-UE)

# Notes on working with ROS 2 and UE

- rcl and void\* types cannot be managed by UE (no UPROPERTY) and therefore can't be used directly in Blueprint. Whenever access to these variables is needed, the user should write a class to wrap it and all of their handling must be done in C++.
- some basic numerical types are not natively supported in Blueprint (e.g. double, unsigned int). In order to use these, a workaround is needed (a plugin implementing those types for BP, a modified UE or a custom implementation).
- In autogenerated messages, the method MsgToString() should be implemented by the user as its current purpose is to help debugging.

# How to update ROS inside RclUE

Currently there is a scripts in [UE_tools](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/UE_tools) to automatically build and update ROS2 libraries. Please follow [steps](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/UE_tools#general-usage)

# Add CustomMsg in rclUE or other Plugins
Please check [CustomMsgExample](https://github.com/yuokamoto/rclUE-Examples/blob/custom_msg_example/Plugins/CustomMsgExample/README.md) as a example of custom msg in different plugin then rclUE.
